# Obfuscation
Code Obfuscation using Recurrent Neural Networks.

This project focuses on using Sequence-to-sequence models built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to automate source code obfuscation.

## Installation

Tensorflow is required. To install required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run the project, run `python ./src/main.py`.

## Files Overview

- `encrypt/encryption()` generates obfuscated code.
- `decrypt/decryption()` generates keys and verifies evaluation.
